# Final-Year-Game
This is my final year project's video game source code called Bald Man's Adventure.

In order to run the exported game, please follow these steps:
1) Download all the files from https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1e_7-IMLyp4FI-1o-WwaFnz230LMTauF4
2) If you are logged into Google, click on the Bald Man's Adventure in the path (My Drive -> Bald Man's Adventure) and press Download.
If you are logged out, Download All button should be in the top-right corner of your screen.
3) A zip file should be downloaded. Export the folder and open it.
4) Run the .exe file and enjoy the gameplay!

Here is the board I use to keep track of the tickets: https://trello.com/b/6R4nc3y1/final-year-project
